# Bolean-Resolution-Function
Gridworld 4x4 grid AI for navigating to end goal in optimal time determining optimal policies in each instance of a gridworld. 

Two solutions were implemented. One solution uses Q-Learning with greedy exploration to perform reinforcement learning. The other solution implements a value iteration method for the Markov Decision Process.
